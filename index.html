                <h2>To make the palak paneer</h2><br>
                <p>To toast the paneer, heat oil in a pan (ideally non stick) on a 
                    low/medium heat setting. Once hot add the paneer, cumin seeds 
                    and a pinch of salt. Allow the paneer to cook for 10-15 seconds until it is light 
                    golden in colour. Then turn over each piece and cook on the other side. 
                    (You want just a light golden skin on each piece). Remove from pan and keep aside.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    In the same pan, heat up oil and butter/ghee. Once hot, 
                    add the nigella seeds, garlic & ginger. Keep mixing continuously on a
                    medium heat until light golden in colour. 
                    (It won't take long â€“ do not allow it to brown too much as it will burn and become bitter).
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Now add the chopped tomato and pasata and cook for 2 minutes on a medium heat whilst mixing. 
                    Then add the salt and remaining spices.
                </p><br>

                <h2>For optional garlic tempering</h2><br>
                <p>
                    Once you see the oil begin to release at the edge of the tomato paste, add the toastetoasted 
                    paneer pieces and green chilli and mix. 
                    Now begin to add the spinach a couple of handfuls at a time, mixing as you do it.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    For the tempering, heat oil in a small pan. Then add the garlic slivers and dried fenugreek. 
                    Keep stirring and as soon as you see the garlic take on a light golden colour, turn off the heat. 
                    Drizzle over the paneer palak and serve with your favourite Indian breads.
